How do I add my CKAN instance?
==============================

First create an issue for the instance here: https://github.com/okfn/ckan-instances/issues/new (please use: https://github.com/okfn/ckan-instances/issues/1 as a template).

Once you have done that if you are more geeky and understand git and JSON you can help us out even more, by making a pull request (if you aren't geeky, don't worry we'll do it at some point)

1. Locate the `instances.json` file here: https://github.com/okfn/ckan-instances/blob/gh-pages/config/instances.json
2. Take the data from the issue you created and make a pull request
3. Also remember to add your image at `/images/instance/{id}.png` (where `{id}` is the "id" from the `instances.json` file)
